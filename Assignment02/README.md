# DH110: Usability Testing (Pilot)
### Karen Li
## Introduction
The goal of the NoWaste app is to reduce food waste by allowing users to clearly keep track of the food they have. Users can log each food item they have into different categories – fridge, freezer, and pantry. Users can update each food item’s remaining amount, expiration date, storage information, and more. Additionally, they can create shopping lists which can be moved to the storage list once bought. 

My heuristic evaluation first noted that the app required discovery to fully take advantage of its functionality, as several features were not intuitive. As such, the flexibility and efficiency of the use can be improved. While I did not write of any particular flaws of this heuristic in my evaluation and instead spoke of the app’s customizability, upon a further analysis I discovered many features that may need to be updated. It is because of this app’s wide range of customization that users may struggle to understand its interface. Additionally, the app is flawed in its consistency and freedom. A checkmark usually indicates that something is complete or completed; however, clicking the checkmark button in NoWaste is actually to select it. 

In light of these discoveries, I will conduct a usability test to discover how the app’s design may impact a user’s ability to complete common tasks. Usability tests are intended to examine an app or website’s functionality and uncover any usability issues, which affect its overall effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. These usability sessions are recorded in order to analyze user behaviors and emotions. These findings are important for crafting improvements for users of the app. Task 1 focuses on asking the user to display only the items in the fridge category. I hope to gain insight into how effective and natural this feature (of seeing items belonging to a specific category) feels. In Task 2, I ask the user to add ‘eggs’ and ‘bananas’ to the ‘Essentials’ function. Similarly, I want to understand whether this feature is intuitive and easy to navigate. Lastly, task 3 asks the user to let the app know that they have consumed ‘pasta’ that they logged. This checks how well the checkmark button is perceived as a ‘select’ function. 

## Methodology
The pilot usability test will proceed as a remote Zoom session. Both the moderator and participant will conduct the session in their own homes. My computer will display the usability testing survey while recording the participant’s face and reactions. The participant will screen record their phone during the tasks portion of the usability test. This usability test is intended as a pilot test. 

First, the moderator will introduce the usability test to the participant before reading the informed consent. After and only if the participant agrees, the moderator will sign the participant’s name stating that they consent to the terms of the usability test. The moderator will then ask some background questions and the pre-test questionnaire before beginning the tasks portion. When the tasks are completed, the moderator will ask the post-test questionnaire, SUS, Production satisfaction card, and finally conclude with demographic information. The participant will assess their perception of the app’s complexity, ease of use, inconsistency, functionality, learnability and other related topics. The participant will also explain how they felt about their experience with using the app.

## Reflection
I learned several things after conducting this pilot test. Firstly, participants can be very patient and understanding. While my participant successfully completed all tasks, he had a little trouble at first with all three tasks, especially with the last task. However, when completing the post-test questionnaire, he said that the first task was easy, the second task was somewhat easy, and the third task was very easy. As such, it seems that while he had some trouble navigating through the app interface, he was very willing to accept these challenges and did not get annoyed at all. So what I perceive as a usability issue, users may not. However, I think it is still the job of user experience designers to eliminate these small troubles as much as possible; there are definitely aspects of the app that can be improved to create a better and smoother user experience. 

In the future, I will definitely need to prepare better. While I thought the Zoom recording was capturing my participant’s face at all times, this was not the case. I did not realize that whenever I was speaking, my participant’s face would disappear. This is a crucial issue I need to fix. Thankfully, his face showed every time he was speaking. Additionally, I noticed that on the Production satisfaction card section, I made a typo so one of the 18 words were not used. In other words, I need to be more thorough with double-checking my work. 

I do think that I did a good job in listening to the participant and making sure he was heard. I wrote down the notes and answers carefully and confirmed with him what I was writing down was accurate. However, in the future, I want to ask more follow-up questions. The testing environment was quiet without distractions. The participant also provided really good feedback and suggestions for the app at the end of the session, which I will definitely consider for improving the app.
