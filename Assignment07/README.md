# DH 110: High Fidelity Prototype
#### Karen Li | Fall 2022

## Overview 
My project focuses on improving the existing NoWaste app, a food tracking app that allows users to reduce food waste by being more aware of the food that they have and when these ingredients will go bad. Through my user research, I found that one of the main issues involved engagement with the app. As such, I designed two features: the ‘Visual Fridge’ feature and the ‘Saved Locations’ feature. The visual fridge allows users to click into specific sections of their fridge and see what ingredients are there. Users can use the NoWaste app to quickly check their fridge instead of physically having to go to the kitchen. The ‘Saved Locations’ feature enables users to save the locations of their homes and grocery stores they frequent. When the app detects the user is at the grocery store, it will alert the user to open the shopping list in the app; this way, the user will not forget to buy any important ingredients. When the app detects the user is at home after a grocery trip, it will send a notification reminding the user to log their groceries into the app.

This high fidelity prototype is designed to translate the proposed features visually into the app. The high fidelity prototype looks very similar to the end-product in terms of detail and functionality. The goal is to test and evaluate its design, so that further improvements can be made before the product is finalized. 

I used Figma for this high fidelity prototype. I translated my low fidelity wireframes into high fidelity using the design system I created in the previous assignment. Additionally, I changed a few things from my low fidelity prototype. First, the select button uses a ‘checkmark’ icon. I changed it to a ‘radio’ icon since I believe it is more intuitive. Secondly, I changed the word ‘Write’ to ‘Add’ in the action bar. I think it makes more sense to ‘Add’ an item instead of to ‘Write’ an item. I also utilized components, which is a very helpful function in Figma. To illustrate the wireflow, I used the plugin Autoflow.

## Tasks
Task 1: Navigate to specific section of the fridge
- Can you tell me what is in the middle shelf of the fridge?
Task 2: Add a new item in a specific section of the fridge
- Can you add ‘Limes’ to the right drawer of the fridge?
Task 3: Add a new location
- Can you add ‘Whole Foods Market’ to your ‘Saved Locations’?

**The purple flow lines represent Tasks 1 and 2. 
The red flow lines indicate Task 3.**

## Cognitive Walkthrough
During class time in week 8, I conducted a cognitive walkthrough with two of my classmates. The process took around 15 minutes. They first did an impression test, and then I explained to them the purpose of my app. I also discussed my personas as well as their scenarios. Then, I took them through three tasks showing them where each screen led to. The tasks that I tested were: navigating to a specific section of the fridge (visual fridge feature), adding a new food item in a specific section of the fridge (visual fridge feature), and adding a new saved location (saved locations feature). Afterwards, they gave me feedback which can be found below.

| | **Classmate #1** | **Classmate #2** |
|-|--------------|--------------|
| **What do you see?** | Teal background, two options in main screen and navigation menu at the bottom. Search bar at the very top. | List and fridge icon, navigation menu on the bottom, search bar at the top |
| **What do you think that web/app is about?** | Some kind of food service I'm guessing. | finding food online, organized by sustainability level |
| **What do you think you can do with this web/app?** | It looks like you can shop for various foods and organize them into a fridge view schematic. | online shopping, cart is fridge view |
| **Any other comments?** | I like the colors featured in this application. | design looks consistent | **Is there any point that the users may not understand what this screen(feedback) is about?** | The interface looks good, some confusion may occur when adding things to your fridge, but that's mainly because its a unfamiliar process through an app. | I  don't think so |
| **Is there any point that the users may not recognize where to click or select?** | From my experience, yes when trying to add things to fridge, however after learning how to do this once, it is very easy to replicate. | I wasn't really sure if the "name" view was the search bar |
| **Is there any point that the users may feel lost and may not sure whether the progress is being made toward what they want to achieve?** | After receiving the task, I didn't know exactly what to do or where to go, however in hindsight everything made perfect sense | a little confused whether we were adding items from house or store |
| **Is there any point that the users would not know what to do the next step?** | There are some points of confusion but overall very good interface design and great idea in general. | |
| **Is there any point that is not clear where to return or missing back-flow of cancel or exit?** | There isn't any point that is not clear to return or missing back-flow of cancel or exit. | no there is a back button |
| **Is there anything inconsistent, missing, or confusing?** | Nothing is inconsistent, and once you do a task it is very easy to replicate. | some fridge sections have the same name which could be confusing |
| **Any other comments?** | Great job, everything works well and the app looks amazing | no |

My wireflow testing in assignment 5 (low-fidelity prototyping) went very well, so I was a little surprised by the findings of the cognitive walkthrough. Particularly, my classmates did not understand what the purpose of my app was while doing the impression test. They both thought it was an app for online shopping, so this is something I need to change before conducting my usability test. Classmate #1 expressed that the app may be confusing at first, but is easy to learn and understand. Classmate #2 said that they thought my tasks were confusing, but I think it may be because they did not really understand the purpose of my app. This is another reason why I will focus on making the purpose of my app clearer. Additionally, I will also work on improving the intuitiveness of the user flow for the tasks since classmate #1 mentioned there were “some points of confusion”. On the other hand, they both thought my design was consistent and that there was good visibility of system status, so I will not be making any major changes there.
