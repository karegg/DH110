# Heuristic Evaluation: Consuming More Responsibly in Our Daily Lives

### Karen Li / DH 110

For the design challenge of this quarter, I chose the UN global goal “Responsible Production and Consumption”. Particularly, I want to focus on responsible consumption and how users can apply it to their own daily lives. Thus, I want to create a website/app that focuses on a specific way of consuming responsibly (e.g. secondhand shopping, reducing food waste) and improves on its current user experience. 

To conduct this analysis, I will be following the heuristics and severity ratings as outlined by Jakob Nielsen and the Nielson Norman group.

## The Ten Heuristics
1. Visibility of system status: users are able to know what is happening at all times.
2. Match between system and the real world: the design uses language and conventions that users are familiar with.
3. User control and freedom: users have control over their actions (e.g. undo, exit)
4. Consistency and standards: design choices are consistent throughout the product.
5. Error prevention: the design prevents and reduces any errors made.
6. Recognition rather than recall: the design minimizes the information a user has to memorize, by keeping important elements visible and offering suggestions.  
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use: the interface is tailored to both new and expert users, providing the latter with shortcuts.
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design: the design focuses on important elements, and is not crowded with unnecessary information.
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: when an error is made, the interface quickly helps the user solve the issue.
10. Help and Documentation: information to complete a task is easily accessible when the user requires it. 

## Severity Ratings
1 = the issue is only cosmetic; should be fixed if there is extra time
2 = minor usability issue; low-priority
3 = major usability issue; high-priority

## Poshmark Website
Poshmark is a website and app that allows users to sell and buy second-hand items, such as clothing, accessories, and home decor. Shopping second-hand is a great way to consume more responsibly. For this heuristic evaluation, I will be analyzing the website.

| Heuristic | Evaluation | Improvement | Severity Rating |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| Visibility of system status | Clickable items do not change color when hovered on. Moreover, some clickable items are gray, the same color as text that does not afford clicking. This means users may not know what is clickable and may easily misclick. | Add color feedback when clickable items are hovered over. | 2 |
