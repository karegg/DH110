# DH 110: Contextual Inquiry
### Karen Li // Fall 2022

## Design Challenge
**What is the main activity your project would support for users?**
> This project will support users in reducing their food waste and learning about the personal impact they have made. 

**What is the basic need/goal for that activity?**
> This activity helps fulfill users’ need for esteem, in that they are being conscious of their carbon footprint and are actively helping to mitigate consequences of global warming by reducing their food waste. Additionally, this activity can also improve a user’s feeling of safety, as minimizing their food waste can allow them to save money; this, in turn, positively affects their level of financial security.

**What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
> There are many different ways for people to reduce food waste: keeping inventories of their pantries, meal prepping, eating leftovers, buying locally, donating extra food to those in the community via apps, and composting

**What is/are the limitations(s) that possibly would be improved?**
> As mentioned above, there are many solutions a user can take to minimize their carbon footprint. Some of these solutions may seem too time-consuming and may take too much effort for users, especially using an app to find places to donate to and then having to get to that place or shopping at a farmer’s market instead of a grocery store. Other methods may require buying physical items (such as tupperware for meal prepping or a compost bin). Users who choose to use food tracking apps as a method to reduce their food waste will not face these issues of time and effort since the app can be downloaded quickly and can be used as frequently or infrequently as they wish.

## Target Users
**What are characteristics of users?**
> - Demographics: people who want to reduce their food waste, likely to be adults as they tend to be ones to be buying groceries
> - Preference: users want to reduce their food waste in a simple way
> - Expertise: no expertise is needed for this activity
> - Mainstream vs. extreme: the mainstream user would likely be the average adult. Extreme users would be people who care deeply for the environment and want to make a sizable personal impact. 

**In which context would users do that activity?**
> Users would like to reduce their food waste in the comfort of their own homes or at the places where they buy food. It does not seem like people will want to go out of their way and change up a big part of their routine in order to do the activity. They also don’t want to do an activity that requires a lot of time for a small reward, since reducing food waste doesn’t have an immediate benefit to the user besides saving some money. As such, they prefer a minor change in their daily lives and something that is convenient for them, but is also helpful. I think that people are more willing to use compost bins than drive to donate excess food to restaurants and other collection sites. 

**What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?**
> For users who are not knowledgeable and want to reduce their carbon footprint, they will probably search for ways to do so. Then, they will buy the necessary items needed to complete the activity, such as tupperware for repurposing leftovers and a bin for composting. Afterwards, they will start the habit of doing the activity of reducing food waste. However, if the activity poses a major inconvenience to them or takes more effort than expected, they will probably stop. 

## Research Materials
> For this research, I decided to employ participatory interaction and an interview. I asked my participant questions about relevant issues and topics, as well as gave them a few tasks and observed them while they completed the activities.

## Quotes and Insights 
Here are some points from my participant that I found interesting: 

**Can you tell me the process of how you reduce food waste? Do you use leftovers?**
> Yes, I do try to use leftovers. Sometimes, when I cook, I actually intentionally cook so that I have leftovers so that I don’t have to make the effort into cooking the next day.

**What would you say is the reason you choose to reduce your food waste?**
> I think I get very hung up on specific, particular things about food like ‘I have to eat this or I have to finish this leftover within a few days’ just because that’s how I grew up. It’s kind of ingrained in me. So it’s very automatic. I don’t necessarily think about it, even if it’s certain things that I do that do reduce food waste. I’m not doing it for that reason necessarily, but it’s just because I’m so used to doing it that way.

**How do you food track? Do you keep it in your mind? Do you use a notebook, website, or app?**
> I just look at my fridge. I think it’s really like a visual reminder of what I have and, because I buy groceries like once a week, it’s not like I have so much food where I would need to keep track of it. But if I buy a lot of snacks and I have too much, I forget about some and think ‘Oh, I’ll eat them later’ but then, it ends up going past its expiration date, and that would go to waste.

**What kind of people do you think would be most and least likely to use food tracking apps to reduce food waste? What about children?**
> I think honestly, I feel like depending on how the app is designed and what it looks like, children can actually have a lot of fun like adding stuff … I think it’ll be fun if it was collaborative … I feel like talking to another family member about it, or with friends, like keeping track of it – it’s like a fun interactive activity.

**Can you think of a circumstance where you’d be more willing to use these types of food tracking apps?**
> I think if I notice a big problem with food waste, like ‘Oh, I didn’t even know I had this’, and it’s like a reoccurring problem where I keep forgetting about the food I buy and it keeps going to waste that I would be more inclined to use this app.


## Reflection 
I have never fully written interview questions before, so it was quite difficult for me to come up with some of the questions. Some of the questions I wrote seemed too simple. I understand though that it is important to still ask simple questions in order to avoid making assumptions. I think I may have written down a couple too many questions since my interview ended up being a little over an hour long. I underestimated the time that would take my participant to answer them. Also, I am not sure if I went too broad since a lot of my questions and two of my activities revolved around food waste and the app I am interested in is about food tracking to reduce food waste. However, I am glad that I asked a lot of questions about food waste in general since it gave me good insight into what matters to my participants when they are considering how to reduce their food waste. With this knowledge, I am brainstorming features that I could implement into the app redesign that I otherwise would not have if I had limited my questions to just food tracking. On the other hand, I do think that I asked pretty good follow up questions to my participant and they were very receptive. The recording also went much better as I was better prepared this time.
