# Reducing Food Waste Via Food Tracking
### Karen Li | DH 110 UX+UI Design | Fall 2022

## Design statement 
My UX design problem was to reduce food waste via food tracking. Specifically, it is an Un goal: Responsible Prodution and Consumption.

## Research 
I conducted a [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/karegg/DH110/blob/main/Assignment01/README.md) of Poshmark and NoWaste before deciding that I wanted to focus on the issue of food waste. I researched current solutions to the problem and conducted a [contextual inquiry](https://github.com/karegg/DH110/blob/main/Assignment03/README.md).

## Design
After conducting user research, I developed two personas: Margot and Chad. The first is a stay-at-home mom in her 30s, and the other is a young fit professional. I created scenarios for them, in which I came up with two new features. You can see my personas and scenarios [here](https://github.com/karegg/DH110/blob/main/Assignment04/README.md). My ideas involved creating two new features to the app: a ‘Visual Fridge’ feature and a ‘Saved Locations’ feature. I created low-fidelity [wireframes and wireflows](https://github.com/karegg/DH110/blob/main/Assignment05/README.md). Then, I made some [GUI design variations](https://github.com/karegg/DH110/blob/main/Assignment06/README.md), and an [interactive prototype](https://github.com/karegg/DH110/blob/main/Assignment07/README.md) for these features.

## Evaluation
To test my solutions, I conducted a cognitive walkthrough as well as usability testing to 3 participants.
