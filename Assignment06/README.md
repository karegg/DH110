# DH 110: Interface Design
#### Karen Li | Fall 2022

## Overview
My project focuses on reducing food waste via a food tracking app called NoWaste. NoWaste allows you to keep a log of your food items, providing information on expiration dates, storage information, and more. The goal of interface design is to digitize low-fidelity wireframes and create a style that will act as a guide for high-fidelity prototyping; it is another big step towards realization of the end product. I used the app Figma for this process. I decided to focus on one of the ‘Fridge List’ screens and created different typographic, shape, and color variations for the screen. I conducted color-contrast accessibility tests as well as an impression test.

The user thought the screen was pleasing to the eye and liked the colors. They liked how the buttons were round and that there weren't sharp edges. It seems that they liked the font, since they mentioned that it was easy to read and not distracting. Based on looking at the screen, they assumed it was an app to keep track of expiry dates. They said they think it would help with grocery shopping and planning meals.

I am happy with the result of the impression test, since the user did not mention any flaws. However, I think that going forward I will ask for a couple more opinions just to make sure that any flaws are not missed.

## Decision Making Process
I originally used Hind Kochi for the text in the Low-Fidelity prototyping, because I thought it fit very well - it is a nice and clean sans-serif font. I tried two other fonts: DM Mono which is a sans font, and Manrope which is another sans-serif font. I tried
