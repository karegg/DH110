# DH 110: Persona + Scenario
#### Karen Li | Fall 2022

## UX Storytelling
UX storytelling is designed to better understand the user of the product – to put yourself in their shoes. Drafting personas and their narratives allows a researcher to empathize with them, understand their needs, motivations, goals, challenges, and frustrations. This, in turn, allows the researcher to create solutions that are not based on their own biases and opinions, but rather focuses on the direct user. It is important to consider personas with a wide range of characteristics, as users are diverse and have different needs and goals.

## Scenario and Journey Map
### Margot: Visual Fridge Feature
Margot has just gotten home after picking the kids up from school. She soothes her youngest child, aged 1, into her nap. After putting the baby down into their crib, she walks into the living room where she watches her middle and oldest child, aged 3 and 5, playing with legos. It’s 4 pm. Margot has an hour and a half before her husband comes home from work. It’s time to start cooking dinner. She opens the fridge and is instantly overwhelmed – it’s jam-packed. That’s right, she and her husband went grocery shopping just two days ago and bought enough to feed the family for the next couple of weeks. 

Since Margot is so busy thinking about cleaning the house, doing laundry, and making sure the kids make it to school and all her extracurricular activities on time, she doesn’t have the mental space to remember where all the ingredients are in her fridge. And they have a huge fridge. Good thing she downloaded the NoWaste app a few days ago after seeing it online while browsing for ways to reduce her carbon footprint. She was also tired of tossing out spoiled food from the back of the fridge. 

Margot opens the app and clicks on the Visual Fridge feature. Once she had put all the ingredients she bought at the grocery store into her fridge, she had logged where the items were in her fridge. The app displays her fridge separated into shelves and sections. Margot clicks on the top shelf. Now she has the option to choose the front or back of the top shelf. She selects the back of the shelf. The app tells her that in the back of the top shelf of her fridge, there are: bell peppers, chicken wings, leftover rice, and carrots. She realizes that she bought the bell peppers and carrots awhile ago, so she should use them soon. She puts the phone down and opens the fridge. She digs through the back and finds the bell peppers and carrots. Indeed, they are looking like they are about to go bad. Margot decides to make a stew after using the app again and seeing that there was some beef on the bottom shelf that was also bought awhile ago. Margot sighs of relief, happy that she didn’t let these ingredients go to waste.

### Chad: Notification Feature
It is currently 6pm on a Wednesday, and Chad has just gotten off work. He stayed an hour late to add the finishing touches on a big project that he has to present tomorrow morning. He is not worried about the presentation since he has always been good at public speaking and is well-prepared. What’s on his mind, however, is what he is going to have for dinner tonight. His fridge is pretty much empty, because he hasn’t been able to go to the grocery store in the past two weeks due to the big project. He drives home, thinking about the list of ingredients he wants to buy: steak, ground chicken, soy milk, broccoli, peanut butter, garlic, greek yogurt… 
He arrives home and changes into some workout clothes. Before leaving for the grocery store, he downloads an app called NoWaste. His coworker and gym buddy, Ben, had told him about the app after Chad mentioned his problem of often forgetting to buy certain ingredients at the store. Chad has tried writing down what he needs to buy in the Notes app, but will often forget about it at the grocery store when he’s distracted by the thousands of items the store offers. Ben said the NoWaste app would help with this problem and that it was also useful in keeping track of food in the fridge. Chad opens the app, which prompts two pop-ups: one to get Chad’s location and the other to send Chad notifications. Chad accepts and adds ingredients he needs to buy to the ‘Shopping List’. 
Once he’s done, he puts his phone in his pocket and jogs to the grocery store. He grabs a cart, enters the grocery store, and gets a ping from his phone. It’s the app telling him that he appears to be in a grocery store and tells him to check his shopping list. Chad smiles at the reminder, as he knows he won’t be forgetting to buy anything this shopping trip. He fills his cart up with items he logged into the app earlier, checking off each item as he walks through the store. He pays for his food and leaves, thinking about how he should thank Ben the next time he sees him.
